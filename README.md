### Hi ðŸ‘‹.  
I'm Ahmed, a Junior Full-Stack Developer. My background is in science and academia (Chemistry PhD) but I fell in love with computers and code. I recently completed a three-month intensive coding bootcamp at nology.io.

### My learning philosophy:
- Gain an understanding of how higher level abstractions work by building up mastery of the fundamentals. 
- Construct accurate mental representations of first principles in order to tackle fundamental engineering problems. 

### My goal:

### Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Python
- CompTIA A+
- CompTIA Network+
